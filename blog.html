                <h2 class="text-5xl font-bold">Scope of var, let, and const</h2>
                <h4 class="text-3xl mt-7">Function-scope vs. Block-scope</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">Before we get find out the scope type of let and var and const in javascript, let us
                    learn some of the differences between function-scope and block-scope:</p>
                <h5 class="text-2xl">Scope</h5>
                <p>Scope stands for where our variable will be available to use inside our code and where it will not.
                    <br>
                    Let's take an example to understand it -
                </p>
                <img src="./images/scope1.PNG" alt="">
                <p>In the example, we have a function myFun(); inside the function, we declare a variable myName and
                    print
                    the variable myName on the console.
                    <br>
                    When we call our function myFun it successfully prints the value of variable myName on the console,
                    but
                    when we try to print the variable myName outside the function, it throws referenceError because
                    variable
                    myName has a function scope that's why it's not accessible outside the function.
                </p>

                <h5 class="text-2xl">Function Scope</h5>
                <p>Variable having Function-scope means variable will only be available to use inside the function it
                    declared, will not be accessible outside of function, and will give Reference Error if we try to
                    access.
                    <br>
                    Here is an example -
                </p>
                <img src="./images/scope2.PNG" alt="">
                <p>In the example, we make a function name() then we declare a variablemyAge inside the function, when
                    we
                    call the function, it prints the myAge variable on the console, But when we try to access the
                    variable
                    outside the function, it's throwing a Reference Error.</p>

                <h5 class="text-2xl">Block Scope</h5>
                <p>Block means a pair of curly brackets, a block can be anything that contains an opening and closing
                    curly
                    bracket.
                    <br>
                    Variable having Block-scope will only be available to use inside the block it declared, will not be
                    accessible outside the block, and will give Reference Error if we try to access.
                    <br>
                    Here is an example -
                </p>
                <img src="./images/scope3.PNG" alt="">
                <p>In the example above, we have an if block with a true condition, and inside the if block, we declare
                    a variable name myName. Now when we try to print the myName variable to the console, it prints
                    successfully, but when we try to print the variable outside the if block, we get a Reference Error.
                </p>
                <p>scope of var, let & const are shown in a table below:</p>

            <section class="mt-16">
                <h2 class="text-5xl font-bold">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
                <p class="mt-5">JavaScript uses null and undefined to represent missing or empty values, but they
                    are used in different contexts and for different purposes. Here are the primary use cases for
                    each:</p>

                <div class="gap-y-4">
                    <h4 class="text-3xl mt-7">Use Cases for 'null'</h4>
                    <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-semibold">1. Explicitly Indicating Absence of Value:</span> You
                        can assign
                        'null' to a variable or property to explicitly indicate that it has no value or that it is
                        empty. </p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">2. As a Placeholder for Future Values:</span> You might
                        use 'null' as
                        a temporary placeholder for a variable or property that will have a value assigned to it later.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">3. To Remove an Object Property:</span> Setting a
                        property of an
                        object to 'null' can be used to remove that property from the object. </p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">4. Clearing Object References: </span> You can set an
                        object
                        reference to 'null' when you no longer need it. This can be helpful for memory management, as it
                        allows the JavaScript engine's garbage collector to reclaim memory used by the object.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">5. Default Values: </span>You can use 'null' as a
                        default value in
                        functions or expressions where you want to indicate that a value should be provided or
                        initialized later.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">6. Array Initialization: </span>You can use 'null' to
                        initialize an
                        array where certain elements are intentionally empty or not yet defined.</p>

                    <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-semibold">1. Default Value for Function Parameters: </span>If a function parameter is not provided when the function is called, it defaults to undefined. You can use this to check if an argument was passed.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">2. Variable Declarations Without Initialization: </span>Variables declared but not assigned a value are automatically initialized to undefined.

                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">3. Return Value of Functions: </span>If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns undefined.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">4. Properties That Don't Exist: </span>If you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, it returns undefined.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">5. Testing for the Existence of Properties: </span>You can use undefined to check if a property exists within an object without triggering a "property not found" error.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">6. Optional Function Arguments: </span>When defining functions with optional parameters, you can check if a parameter is undefined to provide a default behavior.</p>

            <!-- Rest API -->
            <section class="mt-16">
                <h2 class="text-5xl font-bold">What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
                <p class="mt-5">Let's break down REST API in an easy way that we can grasp:</p>
                <h4 class="text-3xl mt-7">What is a REST API?</h4>
                <p class="mt-5">A REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a way for different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other over the internet. It's like a menu in a restaurant: you can see what dishes are available (the endpoints), order what you want (make requests), and get your food (receive data) in a standard and predictable way.</p>
                

                <div class="gap-y-4">
                    <h4 class="text-3xl mt-7">Key Concepts of REST API:</h4>
                    <p class="mt-5"><span class="font-semibold">1. Resources: </span>In the context of REST, resources are like items on the restaurant menu. They are the things you want to interact with, such as users, products, or articles.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">2. HTTP Methods: </span>REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. The most common methods are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>=> <span class="font-semibold">GET: </span>Retrieve data (like reading a menu).</li>
                            <li>=> <span class="font-semibold">POST:</span> Create a new resource (like placing an order).</li>
                            <li>=> <span class="font-semibold">PUT: </span>Update an existing resource (like modifying your order).</li>
                            <li>=> <span class="font-semibold">DELETE:</span> Remove a resource (like canceling your order).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">3. Endpoints: </span>Endpoints are the URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) that represent resources on the API. Think of them as the addresses to access specific items on the menu.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">4. Stateless: </span>REST is stateless, which means each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. It's like each order at a restaurant doesn't rely on previous orders; it includes all the details.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><span class="font-semibold">5. JSON (or XML) Data: </span>Data exchanged between the client and server is often in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language). JSON is like the language both the restaurant and the customer understand.</p>
